# Poto
Full-Stack React Application 

Poto allows logged-in users to view a list of polls created by other users, and then give their opinion by clicking the yes or no button. After clicking the percentage displays immediately after the user clicks yes or no.

The user's polls are displayed on their personal polls page, and the user has the ability to remove their poll from this page. 

The app features full user authentication and allows for the user to create an account for with a unique email, username, password, and profile photo. 

In the future, I would like for users to be able to add their own buttons displaying what they want the other users to pick.
